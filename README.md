# hotel
This is the hotel booking system that I developed for the software engineering project.
It is basically supposed to book a room, cancel, checkout and have an account overview - not very fancy. 

# Requirements
Http server, mysql and php.

# Setting up
In /res/db/ there is the database used for this project.
Simply import into a mysql database.
Change the relevant authentication settings in /res/php/MySQL.php on the first few lines.
