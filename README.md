# hotel
This is the hotel booking system that I developed for the software engineering project.
It is basically supposed to book a room, cancel, checkout and have an account overview - not very fancy. 

# Requirements
Http server, mysql and php.

# Setting up
In ```/res/db/``` there is the database used for this project.
Simply import it into a mysql database.
Change the relevant authentication settings in ```/res/php/MySQL.php``` on the first few lines.

Change lines ```40 - 43``` in ```/res/html/footer.html``` and lines ```7 & 9``` in ```/res/html/head.html```
